# finalportfolio
A portfolio of some of my work that I designed. 
I have five different sections on the website.
These sections are a home, skills, about, projects and a contact.
The home section gives a litte preview of what is to come. It lets you see a few of my different platforms.
The skills section gives a brief overview of the different topics that I have learned during this coding bootcamp.
The about section talks about who I am, and what gave an interest of doing coding and what I plan to do with it.
The contact section lets one have different ways of reaching out to me. 
Each of these sections were created with HTML, styled with CSS, and some Javascript to do different functions.
